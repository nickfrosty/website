# Nick Frostbutter's Personal Website

My personal website.

Home of my various projects, technical writings, and personal blogging.

## Find me online

The current home for my personal site is [frostbutter.com](https://frostbutter.com), but it has changed over the years. And I have my eyes on a very particular domain for it later 😁

## Build Setup

This website is written with `Next.JS` using `TailwindCSS`.

It is built to be primary a static website powered by markdown files.

If you don't know, you can run these 3 commands on this repo to build the site locally:

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# generate static project
yarn generate
```
