# Nick Frostbutter's Personal Website

My personal website.

Home of my various projects, technical writings, and personal blogging.

## Find me online

The current home for my personal site is [nick.af](https://nick.af), but it has changed over the years. This one is hands down my favorite domain ever, and I plan to keep it forever 😁 🥰

## The stack

- `Next.JS` - JS framework to handle the frontend routing
- `TailwindCSS` - styles, color schemes, and designs
- Deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) as a static site

PS: This site is meant to be a markdown powered static website. It uses a helper library I am working on called [`zumo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zumo) that adds assorted helper utilities for generating, filtering, and parsing the markdown files.

## Build Setup

If you don't know, you can run these 3 commands on this repo to build the site locally:

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# generate static project
yarn generate
```
