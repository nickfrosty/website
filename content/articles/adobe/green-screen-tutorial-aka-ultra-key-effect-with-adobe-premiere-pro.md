Working with a green screen, or "**chroma key**", in video editing is such a
cool effect.

![Green screen and chroma key effect tutorial for Adobe Premiere Pro](/media/articles/adobe/green-screen/premiere_pro-green-screen-thumbnail.png)

With this green screen tutorial, you can change the background of any green
screen video all in a matter of minutes. This article will cover how to use the
"**_ultra key_**" effect in Adobe Premiere Pro CC to get your own custom green
screen (chroma key) effect done.

## Quick steps to use Green Screen effects

1. Open your Adobe Premiere Pro project and import your green screen video
2. Add your green screen video on the timeline
3. Add "ultra key" effect to the green screen video
4. Set the ultra key effect's "Key Color" to the green screen color
5. Enjoy your sweet green screen video!

## Step 1: Open your project and import green screen video

After you have your Adobe Premiere Pro project open, import your green screen
video into your project by right clicking on the project panel and clicking on
"Import". Then browse over to your green screen video you are trying to add the
effect to. For this green screen tutorial, I am using a YouTube subscribe button
video animation.

## Step 2: Add your green screen video to the timeline

Once your green screen video clip was imported to your project, you can add it
to the timeline. Select the rough desired time on the timeline where you want
the clip to be. Then add the clip to the timeline using one of these methods,
depending on if you want to keep the green screen clip's audio:

### Method 1 (with audio option):

Drag and drop the video clip onto the timeline to your desired placement. Keep
in mind that this will add **both** the video and audio from the green screen
clip to the timeline. So make sure you place the clip in a good video/audio
track that does not overwrite your existing project audio. Unless that's what
you want, in which case go nuts.

![Add the green screen clip to your project timeline with no audio attached](/media/articles/adobe/green-screen/premiere_pro-green-screen-2-timeline-1.png)

### Method 2: (no audio option):

In the Project panel, double click on the little video reel icon on the video
file itself. This will open the video clip for viewing. In the center of this
new "Source" panel, click and drag the grey video reel icon to your timeline.
This will add **just** the video clip to the timeline. Not the audio from it.

## Step 3: Add the "ultra key" effect

Now that the green screen clip is on your timeline, click on the clip in the
timeline to select it. You should see a white outline around the clip. Locate
your "Effects" panel and search for "ultra key". Once you find the ultra key
effect, drag and drop it onto the green screen video on the timeline.

Pro, check out the Adobe information page
[here](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/how-to/ultra-key-effect.html). It
goes into some nice details if that's the sort of thing you are looking for.

## Step 4: Set the green color key

In the "Effect Controls" panel, you will see the new ultra key effect added. Now
you have to set the color key to that cinematic green color on your video clip.
The easiest way is to click on the little eye dropper icon for the "Key Color"
option.

Then select anywhere on your green screen video where that bright green color
is. Once you select the green color, your green screen clip should now appear to
have a transparent background on the screen. At least everywhere the bright
green color was not of course!

Ensure the correct "blend mode" is set to get your green screen effect with the
best results.

You want the green screen video clip to have a blend mode of "normal". This
usually gives the best results, but if not then play around with the different
options and see which works best.

### Got random green lines everywhere?

You might see them green hairs around your video clip because of the light
distribution from the clip itself. If the video was recorded with less than even
lighting, then the "green" color of the back drop may be slighting different
shades of green all around the video clip.

If your green screen clip does have some stray green lines in the video itself,
try to create a "mask" around your video clip. When you mask around your video
subjects movement, then be sure to play the clip though several times to ensure
you don't mask out any of the subject. That would be awkward. :)

## Step 5: Enjoy your green screen effect!

Now that you've got this chroma key business down, go out there and make some
super cool videos.
