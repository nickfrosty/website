As part of your Solana development journey, you will need to get comfortable
with the Solana CLI.

It is very powerful and very important to understand a few commands to do some
specific tasks:

- create wallets
- update your Solana network settings
- airdrop free SOL (aka fund your account)
- run a test validator
- deploy Solana programs

> PS: I also created a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/pNzT3hgFbpg) for this

This guide assumes you already have the Solana CLI installed. If you do not,
checkout my guide on how to [install Solana on Linux](./setup-solana-on-linux)

</Callout>

## Create a Solana wallet for development

In order to deploy Solana programs to the blockchain (either a local validator
or a remote RPC), you will need to have a Solana wallet created. For simplicity,
we will create a
[file system wallet](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/file-system-wallet)
that will store our private key in a file on your computer. This way, we can
easily tell the Solana CLI and/or Anchor CLI to use this wallet to deploy our
Solana programs.

The default file system wallet is usually located at
_`~/.config/solana/id.json`_. When you create new file system wallets, you can
specify any specific file location with the "_--outfile /path/to/file_" flag.

To create a new Solana wallet:

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/solfate-dev.json
```

When creating each wallet, you can also set a passphrase (just like an SSH
keyfile).

> I STRONGLY RECOMMEND setting a wallet passphrase one, especially for any
> wallet that you may use in production at some point!!!

After your wallet is created, you will get a readout of your "_pubkey_" (aka
your wallet address) and your _seed phrase_. Don't forget to write down your
seed phrase in a safe place if you are going to actually keep this wallet
address.

## Read your Solana config settings

To accomplish anything on the Solana blockchain, even with a local test
validator, you will need to ensure your Solana CLI is set to connect to the
correct Solana RPC network and with the correct wallet.

To see your current Solana CLI settings, run this command:

```bash
solana config get
```

You should get a readout like this:

```bash
Config File: /home/nick/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.testnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.testnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /home/nick/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

The VERY important settings are the "_RPC url_" and the "_keypair file_".

- RPC url - tells the CLI which Solana network cluster you want to connect to.
  Generally, for local developing you should be set to your own local test
  validator (aka localnet). Only the "mainnet" RPCs will actually use real SOL
  tokens and therefore real money
- keypair file - the wallet private key (like the one we created above) to use
  to deploy programs and interact with the RPC

## Update your Solana config settings

When you want to change your Solana network settings or change your default
wallet key file, you will need to update your config settings with the Solana
CLI.

When setting your RPC url (aka changing your Solana network), you can either use
the network short name (like "mainnet", "testnet", etc.) or the full URL for an
active RPC node:

```bash
solana config set --url testnet
```

To change the wallet key file being used by the CLI:

```bash
solana config set --keypair /path/to/file
```

## Check your wallet balance

You will need SOL to interact with the blockchain, even while developing. You
can always easily check your wallet (or anyone's wallet) balance using the
Solana CLI.

To check the balance your CLI configured wallet address (aka the one you have
set with your file system keyfile):

```bash
solana balance
```

To check any other wallet's balance:

```bash
solana balance WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE
```

<Callout>

The `solana balance` command will only check the balance of the given wallet on
the currently selected Solana network.

</Callout>

## Fund your wallet (via airdrop)

With your new wallet setup, and selected to the correct RPC network, you will
need to fund your wallet with SOL. This SOL will be used to deploy programs to
the blockchain, as well as pay for rent and
[transactions](https://docs.solana.com/transaction_fees) while you are
developing programs.

Periodically as your deploy/interact with Solana programs, you will need to fund
your wallet with SOL (the native Solana token).

You can fund your account using two methods:

### 1. Airdrop via the Solana CLI

To request a free airdrop to your currently selected wallet:

```bash
solana airdrop 1
```

<Callout>

The `solana airdrop` command has a limit to the amount of SOL that can be
dropped. Any request passed this limit will cause the transaction to fail. At
the time of writing this, the limit is 2.

</Callout>

Just like you may have guessed, the airdrop will occur on the network you are
selected to in your Solana config settings. And no, airdrop does not work on
mainnet. Don't be silly.

### 2. Airdrop via the Solfate faucet

Another easy way to get your free devnet and/or testnet SOL airdropped to your
wallet is using a public faucet. Here at Solfate, we operate a public
[Solana faucet](https://solfate.com/faucet).

All you need to do is enter your wallet address, and click the button for the
Solana network you want: devnet or testnet

## Run the Solana test validator

Like I mentioned earlier, when you are developing your Solana programs locally
you will most likely want to run a localhost version of the Solana blockchain
called the "test validator". Just like you may think, this will allow you to
full fledge version of the Solana blockchain directly on your local computer.

Running and developing using the test validator is great (and recommended) for a
few reasons:

- even faster transactions (you are the only one making them!)
- less risk of rejected transactions
- no throttling from public RPC endpoints
- easy access to Solana program logs (via the "_msg_" macro in rust)

To run the Solana test validator, open a new terminal window and run the
following command:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

This localhost network, aka "_localnet_", running in your terminal will output
all the messages your Solana program outputs to the blockchain. Which is a great
way to help debug your programs.
