The **Anchor framework** is the most popular rust framework for developing the
on-chain Solana smart contracts called **programs**.

![Get started with Anchor development for Solana](/media/articles/solana/anchor/get-started/get-started-with-anchor-solana-development.png)

## Install the Solana and Anchor CLIs

If you have not already setup your Solana development environment, you can view
our other articles that go in depth on getting setup and all your tooling
installed for Anchor and Solana program development.

- [Install Solana and Anchor on Linux](/articles/setup-solana-on-linux)
- Windows (_coming soon!_)
- Mac OS (_coming eventually?..._)

## Create a new Anchor project

From inside your terminal, you can create a new project using the Anchor CLI:

```bash
anchor init project_name
```

This creates a new directory named `project_name` in your current working
directory, then scaffold out an Anchor _workspace_ for you. The `init` command
will also initialize a new git repo and NPM repo (using Yarn) for you. How sweet
of them :)

You should then `cd` to your new project's root and you can get to work! PS: If
you are using VS Code, be sure to open your new project in your editor's
workspace.

### Anchor project's structure

Your new Anchor project's has a few very important files and folder that were
created during the `init` process.

<Callout>

You _can_ change the names of some of these folders, but I wouldn't. Just keep
them the same as the scaffold and move on :)

</Callout>

#### Important directories

- `app` - the future home of your project's frontend code (aka the JavaScript)
- `programs` - the home of all your project's Solana/Anchor programs (aka the
  rust code), but more on this later
- `tests` - home for your JavaScript based end-to-end tests (using the Mocha
  testing framework)
- `target` - home for your compiled Solana program and Anchor IDL file (more on
  this later too!)

#### Important files

- `Anchor.toml` - manifest file containing config info and settings for your
  Anchor workspace
- `Cargo.toml` - contains the _Cargo_ package manager settings (same idea as
  `package.json` file for Node/NPM projects)
- `package.json` - the standard JavaScript package file that will be used by
  your frontend

## Build your Anchor program

Unlike _vanilla_ rust based on-chain Solana program development, Anchor projects
are built using the Anchor CLI. Which does the same BPF compiling that the
native `cargo-build-bpf` command does, but it also adds in the Anchor magic of
generating the IDL file (I promise, I will get to it. Just not yet...)

To build your Anchor project:

```bash
anchor build
```

### Initial Anchor build

With every new project, I recommend running the `build` command right after your
`init` because it may take some time for the rust compiler to compile all the
assorted libraries used. So go get some coffee.

After the initial build is complete, go ahead and re-run the `anchor build`
command. I'll wait....

It should be much faster. This is because the all the compiled rust code and
packages do not all need to be recompiled from scratch. Each time you rebuild
your project, effectively only the changed files will need to be recompiled.
Making each subsequent build so much faster than the initial.

### Key files generated from the build

The Anchor build command will not only compile your rust code into a deployable
Solana program, but it generates a few other files too.

<Callout>

For simplicity, I will only cover the directly important files/folders generated
from the build command.

</Callout>

Inside your `target` directory, the following important files are generated:

- `deploy/project_name.so` - the Solana program binary ready to be deployed to
  the blockchain
- `deploy/project_name-keypair.json` - a brand-new file system keypair file that
  will be used for your program
- `idl/project_name.json` - a JSON file that will be used by your frontend to
  make interacting with your on chain program even easier
- `types/project_name.ts` - auto generated typescript definitions that will be
  used by your frontend

## Anchor.toml file

The `Anchor.toml` manifest file is where certain configuration settings for your
Solana programs and Anchor workspace will live.

For simplicity, I will only focus on 2 main sections for this
[intro to Anchor]():

- `[programs.cluster]`, and
- `[provider]`

You can read more about the `Anchor.toml` file from the official
[Anchor lang docs](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/manifest).

### Anchor.toml [programs.cluster]

The "programs" setting will allow you to save the string `program_id` of each of
your Solana programs inside your project. Including being able to set a
different `program_id` for each cluster, as desired.

For example, the following stores the `program_id` for the `localnet` cluster:

```toml
[programs.localnet]
demo = "Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS"
```

To store a different `program_id` for different clusters, you can use something
like this:

```toml
[programs.localnet]
demo = "Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS"

[programs.testnet]
demo = "3ze6Z4rR8r8PkYAYYV5yZTRLKAHQMBcJj4AZMg4MS1fG"
```

### Anchor.toml [provider]

You can specify a `provider` to store the desired Solana `cluster` and local
keypair file (aka `wallet`) you want to have ownership of your deployed program.

```toml
[provider]
cluster = "localnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
```

## Your actual Solana program code

Solana programs are different from regular rust based programs. Solana programs
are created as rust "_libraries_" that are able to be loaded into the Solana
blockchain's Sealevel runtime.

By convention, these _libraries_ will typically have their primary code file of
`src/lib.rs` inside of the `programs/program_name` directory of your Anchor
workspace. (e.g. In the case of our example project, "_project_name_", this file
will live at `programs/project_name/src/lib.rs`)

The default Anchor scaffold for `lib.rs` should look something like this:

```rust filename=lib.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod demo {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(_ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

This code, is essentially the most basic Solana Anchor program you can build. It
seriously does nothing, except create itself. This code is the equivalent of
`return true;` in most languages. Let's break down what the program structure
and what is happening.

### Import libraries

Like most other languages, it is also convention to "_import_" all of your
desired items/libraries/crates at the top of your rust file. In rust, the `use`
keyword is used to specify what crates to import into the specific rust file.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
```

For every Anchor based Solana program, the same basic import of the
`anchor_lang` is used to tell the rust compiler to use the Anchor framework
inside our code. Including setting it as part of the _namespace_ so we can call
the Anchor functions and magic sauce in the "_local scope_".

### declare_id

Next, we are using the `declare_id` macro to statically define the `program_id`
(aka _public address_) of our Solana program. This will enable some extra
security in our program, courtesy of the Anchor framework.

This line of code should be in every Anchor program (specifically in `lib.rs`),
and by convention just below your _imports_ at the top of your file.

```rust
declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");
```

By default, the Anchor CLI (and anywhere else you get Anchor program examples)
will have a `program_id` set with this macro.

<Callout type="warn">

You should **ALWAYS** change the value inside if your local source code to be
the address of the keyfile being used to deploy your program (more on this in a
bit).

</Callout>

### The core logic for our Solana program

Next, we are creating a public **_module_** named `program_name` with the
`program` **_attribute_** set on it.

No pun intended but, let's unpack that statement.

```rust filename=lib.rs
#[program]
pub mod program_name {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(_ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Our public "module" will act as the container for the primary execution of code
inside our program. Sort of like functions and methods do in other languages.

The `program` attribute is specially define by Anchor. Not only will handle lots
of the boilerplate that is traditionally written in _vanilla_ Solana programs,
but it will also add some basic security check on our program.

So in a sense, you can think of defining our module with the `program` attribute
like defining the `main()` function in other statically typed languages. Sort
of.

```rust
use super::*;
```

Next we bring all the imported libraries from the `program` attribute into our
local scope within our `program_name` module.

```rust filename=lib.rs
pub fn initialize(_ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
  Ok(())
}
```

Finally we define a very simple `initialize` function that we can use to
actually execute code on the Solana blockchain (via an RPC call).

For Anchor programs, every _endpoint_ function will take one or more parameters.
The first parameter will always be a `Context` of the desired `struct` defined
in your Solana program. You can add more parameters, as needed for your program,
to your functions.

You can read more about the Anchor context in the Anchor lang
[docs](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/the-program-module#context). But the
gist is that this context will give us a very convenient way to read the
accounts submitted to our functions.

We are also stating that our function will always return a `Result` type when it
is complete (aka only 2 possible outcomes). This will allow our `initialize`
function to return `Ok(())` when it is successful, and `Err()` when an error
occurs.

All Solana program functions are required to return a `Result` of some type. The
`Ok` outcome is typically a blank value of `()`, while the `Err()` can be be any
error you as the developer decide to return. Often times, developers will define
a specific `struct` for creating standard/reusable errors. I strongly recommend
doing the same, especially if you are going to open source your code. Think of
others, be considerate!

### Define our basic `struct`

Like I pointed out earlier, we need to define a `struct` used by our `Context`.
This structure will tell Anchor the expected accounts that will be supplied to
your function. And since the Solana runtime requires a complete listing of all
accounts a program execution
[will interact with](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions#accounts),
Anchor can do some useful things.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

In this specific example, our `initialize` function does not actually interact
with any other Solana accounts, so our `Initialize` `struct` can remain
effectively empty.

We are also using Anchor's `derive(Accounts)` macro to add some deserialization
helpers onto our `Initialize` struct.

I will discuss these more in later tutorials when we really use them, but you
can read up on this `Accounts` macro on the Anchor lang
[rust docs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html)

## What's next?

Now that we have gone over a quick overview of the most basic Anchor program, we
will need to make sure we create a Solana wallet and deploy our program to a
Solana cluster.
