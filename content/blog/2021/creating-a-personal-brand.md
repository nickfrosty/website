I have been tossing and turning on the idea for basically years. Swaying back and forth, with varying levels of commitment, on building a "personal brand" for all of my content online.

The biggest problem I think I have is a mental one.

Here is my dilemma: I like to create content online. Writing useful articles, teaching with video recordings, and generally sharing as I build in public. But I find that I really swap back and forth over what "brand" I publish that content under.

Sometimes I publish to my personal website, sometimes to my older YouTube channel, sometimes to other websites that I own and operate.

Right now, I am posting my developer specific articles to one website. Which is different from the [old YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmyKWv4k8GpsnKrFxRJIxg) that I used to publish videos and articles under (which started in 2009 and has over 11k subscribers). A good portion of the content overlaps, being mostly developer tutorials, but some does not. The YouTube channel has some general tech or YouTube specific tutorials on it too.

But I also have my personal website here. Where I like to share the "[build in public](/newsletter)" style content as well as the more personal inner monologue content (like this article here). But I also have some assorted technical/tutorial style articles as well.

I am all over the place.

## No consistency.

Every few years, the good idea machine turns on an decided to change up how I am operating this weird content network that is my digital persona. I get a new domain name, and try to start moving content between the sites. I know this has got to be wrecking any SEO juice that has been collected from the SEO gods. But I do it any way.

Maybe this is just that time of year for me. The time I start thinking about and start wanting to change it up again. Undoing what I did last time.

The last few years, I have noticed myself slipping deeper and deeper into digital minimalism. Creating more clear organizational methods, and simplifying my digital life.

Here is my plan: since I am already wanting to switch this blog over to a different tech stack (I am thoroughly enjoying Nuxt JS and cannot recommend enough), I am going to begin consolidating my digital content. Collecting it into one, cohesive brand. My personal brand. My personal website.

Just me.
